Some Computer myths and lies you were probably unaware of


MYTH 1
YOU HAVE TO RESTART YOUR COMPUTER AFTER EVERY INSTALLATION THAT YOU CONDUCT
Now on very rare occasions, this is a true scenario but most of the time the program runs just fine without restarting your computer. Well, one might argue that the startup installation bar does ask you to restart but that is just a mere formality that they have to abide.

MYTH 2
WINDOWS IS AN INSECURE OPERATING PROGRAM
This is an absolutely true that more hackers target windows computers and there are more viruses for windows but the truth is statistically there are more windows users who take the larger piece of the pie than any other operating system, so naturally there will be more attacks for windows. So, if you just keep your operating system up to date, you are good to go.

MYTH 3
YOU NEED TO SAFELY EJECT THUMB DRIVES BEFORE TAKING IT OUT
This myth started because they wanted to ensure you don’t take out the drive while a program was still running, hence the eject function. Therefore, in reality, it is not something that you must do, but it’s a good practice nevertheless.

MYTH 4
INSTALLATION DISKS
Okay, so this is a very basic myth that even manufacturers follow: giving installation disks with a hardware. This is completely unnecessary to install a software or even a hardware using installation disk when you can download an updated version of it on the manufacturer’s website.

MYTH 5
ANTI-VIRUSES PROTECT DEVICES FROM ALL VIRUSES
Now needless to say this is not true at all. Yes, it will protect your laptop from ongoing viruses but if it’s a new virus, meaning if the virus came after the anti-virus was designed, your device will be affected no matter what.  There is something called Heuristics which studies the behavior of viruses and similar ones regardless of the date it is released can be detected but this has tons of flaws in it and it is not perfect.

MYTH 6
PEOPLE WHO ARE GOOD WITH COMPUTERS CAN FIX ANYTHING COMPUTER RELATED PROBLEMS
No, that is not something that is true. The computer is a vast and complex device and each individual has their own field experience and interests. So, assuming that a computer enthusiast will inevitably know everything about the computer is just a poor assumption.

Some of you might know these are myths already and for some, it may be a shocking piece of information but all in all, there are many such things that we believe just because it happened once to someone whom you knew. So, before believing in something blindly, it doesn’t hurt to know a little more detail about it, does it?
